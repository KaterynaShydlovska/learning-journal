# My 2nd Day at the School :wink:

## _Goal for 2nd Lab is "The Coder's Computer"_
*1. We went for a few steps* 
+ Explored the Terminal
+ Changed the Terminal Profile
+ Installed Tree view
+ Installed Git
+ Installed VSCode Text Editor and etc.

*2. Read introduction to using a terminal*
+ The Command Line
+ Basic Navigation
+ About Files


### First let's see "What Command Line is?"
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


### Also from the reading pert we learnt:

_The most common comand_ :

- **pwd** 

Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
-  **ls**

List the contents of a directory.
-  **cd**

Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
-  **file**

obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
-  **ls -a**

List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.


_Important Concepts_ :

-  **Relative path**

A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
-  **Absolute path**

A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
-  **Everything is a file under**

Even directories.
-  **Linux is an extensionless system**

Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
-  **Linux is case sensitive**

Beware of silly typos.
