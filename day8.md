## Loops

**Loops** check a condition. If it returns _true_, a code block will run.
Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns _true_, the code will run again. It repeats until the condition returns _false_.
There are three common types of loops:

+ **FOR**

If you need to run code a specific number of times, use **for** loop. Im a **for** loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.

+ **WHILE**

If you do not know how many timws the code should run, you can use a **while** loop. Here the codition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is **true**.

+ **DO WHILE**

To **do** ...**while** loop is very similar to the **while** loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition to **false**.


A **for** loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times. Here you can see the condition is made up of the three statements:

1. INITIALIZATION 
2. CONDITION
3. UPDATE

## Key loop concepts

Here a three points to consider when you are working with loops. Each is illustrated in examples on the following three pages.
