## Learning journal

My learning journal is a first small project in the Code Fellows.
It's a small story abot me and my way.

### Growth Mindset in my understending 
A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed. People with a growth mindset understand they can get smarter through hard work, the use of effective strategies, and help from others when needed.

#### 3 reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
 
 1. Don't give up!
 2. Nothing is impossible
 3. Always remember your final goal


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KaterynaShydlovska/learning-journal/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
