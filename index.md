# Welcome to my loarning journal


## Brief introduction of myself :smile:

He, my name is Kateryna. I'm originally from Ukraine. I moved to US 3 years ago. Before to come to _Code Fellows_ I had a long way and tried myself in different areas, after a while I decided to try myself in programming and here I am for today.
Here is link to my github page https://github.com/KaterynaShydlovska.

## My Learning journal is

My learning journal is a first small project in the Code Fellows.
It's a small story abot me and my way.

## Growth Mindset in my understending 
A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed. People with a growth mindset understand they can get smarter through hard work, the use of effective strategies, and help from others when needed.

## 3 reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
 
- **Don't give up!**
- Nothing is impossible
- Always remember your final goal


# My 2nd Day at the School :wink:

## _Goal for 2nd Lab is "The Coder's Computer"_
*1. We went for a few steps* 
+ Explored the Terminal
+ Changed the Terminal Profile
+ Installed Tree view
+ Installed Git
+ Installed VSCode Text Editor and etc.

*2. Read introduction to using a terminal*
+ The Command Line
+ Basic Navigation
+ About Files


### First let's see "What Command Line is?"
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


### Also from the reading pert we learnt:

_The most common comand_ :

- **pwd** 

Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
-  **ls**

List the contents of a directory.
-  **cd**

Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
-  **file**

obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
-  **ls -a**

List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.


_Important Concepts_ :

-  **Relative path**

A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
-  **Absolute path**

A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
-  **Everything is a file under**

Even directories.
-  **Linux is an extensionless system**

Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
-  **Linux is case sensitive**

Beware of silly typos.

# Day 3!

## Git Tutorial.

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

**_Version Control_** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### History of Git

Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002.Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

**So, what is Git?**

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

Git is set up to greatly _minimize_ the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
