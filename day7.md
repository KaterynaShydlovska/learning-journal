# Day 7!

## Continue programming with JavaScript

A _script_ is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

Every step for every task shown in flowchart needs be written in language the computer can understand and follow.

Like learning any new language, we need to get grips with the:

**Vocabulary**: The words that computers understand

**Syntax**: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.

**Important** to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.

To approach your tasks writting a scrit, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task(a flowchart can help).

### Expressions

An expressions evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

1. Expressions that just assign a value a variable

2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

### Operators 

Expressions rely on things called operators.

+ Assigment operators
+ Arithmetic operators
+ String operators
+ Logical operators
+ Compration operators

### What is a function ?

**Functions** let us group a series of statements together to perform a spcific task. If different parts of script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
