# Day 4 JS :smile:

## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

**How to HTML, CSS, JS fit together**

Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

Where:

<html> is _Content Layer_


<css> is _Presentation Layer_


<js> is _Behavior Layer_


Like any language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules for how these can be put together (the grammar and syntax of the language).

We'll start with few of them:


### STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**.


### COMMENTS


You should write **comments** to explain what your code does.
Thay help make your code easies to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.


### VARIABLES


A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job.
It can store this data in variables.


**var** is an example of what programmers call _keyword_.
The JS interpreter knows this _keyword_ is used to create a varible.

### Data Types


- NUMERIC DATA TYPE

- STRING DATA TYPE

- BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
